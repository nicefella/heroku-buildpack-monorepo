# Heroku Multi Procfile buildpack

Imagine you have a single code base, which has a few different applications within it... or at least the ability to run a few different applications. Or, maybe you're Google with your mono repo?

In any case, how do you manage this on Heroku? You don't. Heroku applications assume one repo to one application.

Enter the Monorepo buildpack, which is a copy of [heroku-buildpack-multi-procfile](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi-procfile) except it moves the target path in to the root, rather than just the Procfile. This helps for ruby apps etc.

# Usage

1. Write a bunch of ~~Procfiles~~ apps and scatter them through out your code base.
2. Create a bunch of Heroku apps.
3. For each app, set `APP_BASE=relative/path/to/app/root`, and of course:
   `heroku buildpacks:add -a <app> https://github.com/jan-tee/heroku-buildpack-monorepo`
4. For each app, `git push git@heroku.com:<app> master`

Note: If you already have other buildpacks defined, you'll need to make sure that the heroku-buildpack-monorepo buildpack is defined first. You can do this by adding `-i 1` to the `heroku buildpacks:add` command or changing the buildpack order visually in the application settings under "buildpacks" in the Heroku dashboard.

## Local dependencies

If you have local dependencies (e.g. a lerna monorepo with `file:../packagename` style dependencies pointing to packages contained in the same repo, *exactly one level above your package*) you can add them using the DEPENDENCIES build var. E.g.

1. `APP_BASE=packages/frontend`
2. `DEPENDENCIES=packages/shared packages/util` to include two packages, `packages/shared` and `packages/util`.

would add `packages/shared` and `packages/util` to one level above the Heroku `BUILD_DIR` and make them available for the build process.
